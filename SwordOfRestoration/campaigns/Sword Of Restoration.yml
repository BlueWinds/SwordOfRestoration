They jumped our claim, pushed us off of our own mining platforms, and killed our people. We need your help to make things right - and Director Espinoza owes us a favor. Help us out and we can get you off his kill-list.

          Travel to the outskirts of the system and dock with the JumpShip you find waiting there. It will carry you to Axylus, the pirate moon where a ship named the <i>Scheria</i> crash-landed centuries ago.

          Further details on the job will be provided upon your arrival.

          Commander, I'm setting a course for Lady Centrella's JumpShip. It's strange, though... this moon it's taking us to, Axylus, doesn't appear on any of my maps. Which leads me to wonder: where, exactly, are we going, and how do they intend to get us there?

          This is it... our first strike against my uncle's Directorate. Our first step toward justice. While I lead the Restoration Army against Weldry's primary spaceport, you will launch a sneak attack against the Icebox and liberate it. I know that you can do this, {COMMANDER.Callsign}.

          <i>We</i> can do this. Together.
